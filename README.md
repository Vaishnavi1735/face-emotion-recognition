# Face Emotion Recognition

This project implements a real-time face emotion recognition system using OpenCV and deep learning techniques. It uses a pre-trained model to detect and classify human facial emotions from a webcam feed.

## Description

The system captures video from the webcam, detects faces, and classifies their emotional states such as Happy, Sad, Neutral, Surprise, and others. The emotions are overlaid on the live video feed for real-time display.

This project was completed under the guidance of Mr. T. Muthuvel Ramesh, whose mentorship provided valuable insights into AI and computer vision.

## Key Features

- Real-time emotion detection using webcam
